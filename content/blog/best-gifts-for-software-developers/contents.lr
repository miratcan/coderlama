body:

It's true that software development technologies are constantly evolving, and for books, it can be tough to keep up with latest trends.

But, there are some timeless books, they are always valid and enlightening.

So you can consider buying one of the software development books which I will recommend below. 

The other good thing about buying these books are they are not technology dependent. So you don't need to run an investigation about the technologies that your developer is working on.

title: The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery
-----
description:

The Pragmatic Programmer is one of those rare tech books you’ll read, re-read, and read again over the years. Whether you’re new to the field or an experienced practitioner, you’ll come away with fresh insights each and every time.

Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt wrote the first edition of this influential book in 1999 to help their clients create better software and rediscover the joy of coding. These lessons have helped a generation of programmers examine the very essence of software development, independent of any particular language, framework, or methodology, and the Pragmatic philosophy has spawned hundreds of books, screencasts, and audio books, as well as thousands of careers and success stories.
