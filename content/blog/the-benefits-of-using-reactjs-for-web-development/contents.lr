header: 1. Component-Based Architecture
----
body: One of React's defining features is its component-based architecture. React applications are built by composing small, reusable components. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and a clear separation of concerns. Components can be easily combined to create complex user interfaces, making development more efficient.

header: 2. Virtual DOM (Document Object Model)
----
body:

React's Virtual DOM is a crucial innovation for improving performance. It minimizes the need to interact directly with the browser's DOM, which is typically slow and costly. React creates a virtual representation of the DOM and efficiently updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed, resulting in faster rendering and a smoother user experience.

header: 3. Declarative Syntax
----
body:

React uses a declarative approach to describe the user interface. Developers specify how the UI should look and behave in various states, and React takes care of updating the DOM to match those specifications. This approach simplifies code and makes it easier to understand and maintain.

```python
// Example of React's declarative syntax
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

header: 5. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
----
body: React allows for server-side rendering, which improves search engine optimization (SEO) and initial page load performance. With SSR, web pages can be partially rendered on the server, reducing the time it takes to display content to the user.
